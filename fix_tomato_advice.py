tomato_early_blight_advice = """TREATMENT:
Remove infected lower leaves immediately and dispose of them (do not compost). Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based products every 7-10 days. Organic options include copper fungicides, neem oil, or sulfur products. Ensure proper spacing between plants to improve air circulation.

PREVENTION:
Practice crop rotation (don't plant tomatoes in the same spot for 3-4 years). Use drip irrigation or water at the base to keep foliage dry. Mulch around plants to prevent soil splash. Choose resistant varieties when available. Remove plant debris at the end of the growing season.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
Early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and typically appears first on older, lower leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings (bull's-eye pattern). It thrives in warm (75-85Â°F), humid conditions, especially with alternating wet and dry periods. Without treatment, it can cause significant defoliation and reduce yields by 30-50%."""
